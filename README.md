## Overview

mini-nyt is a mock take home challenge assigned in the final module in Turing School of Software & Design. mini-nyt consumes 'Top Stories' API from the New York Times(NYT).

## Endpoints

As the app loads, the data is fetched using a GET request to the Top Stories API.

### Example Endpoint

`https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/home.json?api-key=yourkey`

### API Key

An API key is required by NYT to consume their APIs. The instructions are found here. Once a key has been created, the app was registered to authenticate access.

By storing the API key in a `.env` file as an environment variable, and adding that file to the `.gitignore` file, I was able to hide the API key.
